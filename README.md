Simple PYthon Blogging EnginE
=============================

### Built on the bottle.py web framework. ###

Writing Posts
-------------

Blog posts are placed in the 'posts' folder and are written in markdown.
For a blog post to be displayed, there needs to be a '<name>.json' file and
a '<name>.md' file. The json file needs to have a 'timestamp' (which is a unix
timetstamp) and optionally, a list of 'tags'. Tags currently serve no purpose,
but in the future, they may be used for bucketing posts together.

Customization
-------------

You can change what the homepage says by editing home.md. If this file does
not exist or markdown causes an error for whatever reason, nothing will be
shown on the homepage.

Dependencies
------------

Depends on python-argparse, python-markdown and python-json. By
default, spybee also uses python-paste as an alternate webserver so
that multi-threading is possible, but this isn't hard to change using
bottle.

Running
-------

Run with 'python main.py'. Use '-p' to specify port and '-d' to turn on
debug mode.

Future plans
------------
- Title and footer customization
- Tag filtering
- RSS
