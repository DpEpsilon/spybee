Simple PYthon Blogging EnginE
Uses the bottle.py web framework.

Blog posts are placed in the 'posts' folder and are written in markdown.
For a blog post to be displayed, there needs to be a '<name>.json' file and
a '<name>.md' file. The json file needs to have a 'timestamp' (which is a unix
timetstamp) and optionally, a list of 'tags'. Tags currently serve no purpose,
but in the future, they may be used for bucketing posts together.

Depends on python-argparse, python-markdown and python-json.
